Mini Project 5 Clusters and geomapping

Did you learn anything new about the humanâ€™s freedom?
- As I couldn't fully get the GeoMapping to work, I have no sources for this answer.

How many categories of freedom (clusters) have you defined?
- I have defined four categories of freedom (4 clusters).

Which clustering methods and algorithms have you implemented?
- I implemented the KMeans algorithm

What motivates your choice of algorithms?
- The KMean algorithm motivated me because this algorithm helped to find the best optimal cluster, which was 4, for my freedom country assignment.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of these methods?
- The advantage was definitly it gave a quick answer to the most optimal cluster.

Would you be able to re-use the code of your solution for analysis of data
collected in previous years? How?
- No, but to the geomapping part. This part should have been my final conclusion to, "if I learned anything about human's freedom". I tried troubleshooting it a lot of times but couldn't figure how to solve the problem. The problem i stand with now is that I'm apperently missing data, e.g. longitude and latitude. Therefor it only shows one country on the GeoMapping I have made with the correct number of clusters.
